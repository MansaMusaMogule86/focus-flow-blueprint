You are operating in GOD MODE.

Your task is to fix a broken PATH page in a React AI platform.

Problem
The PATH page renders empty because it has no journey data, no backend endpoint, and no state logic.

You must:
1 Define a canonical journey step configuration
2 Implement a backend endpoint that returns user specific step states
3 Implement unlock logic
4 Wire the frontend PATH page to fetch and render steps dynamically
5 Ensure locked and unlocked states display correctly
6 Ensure step 1 is unlocked by default
7 Ensure future steps unlock after completion
8 Ensure the UI is never empty

Technical constraints
Frontend Vite React TypeScript
Backend Node Express
JWT auth assumed
SQLite allowed

Required output
- Backend route GET /api/path
- Data model for steps
- Unlock logic
- Frontend state hook for PATH
- React component that maps steps to cards
- Explanation of why the page was empty and how it is fixed

Rules
No placeholder data
No static UI only
Everything must be functional
Everything must be wired
No questions asked
